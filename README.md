The 2.9 inch ePaper Breakout Board is a specialized expansion board designed for seamless integration with Seeed Studio's XIAO development board and Raspberry Pi. This board offers a highly flexible and convenient way to incorporate ePaper display capabilities into a wide range of projects, from smart homes to industrial control systems and educational applications. The board comes equipped with a XIAO socket, a 40-pin header for Raspberry Pi, a 4-pin Grove connector, and a user button, providing multiple options for connectivity and control.

**Note**: This expansion board **does not include** a 2.9-inch ePaper display; the display must be purchased separately.

## Features

- **High Compatibility**: Designed for seamless integration with Seeed Studio XIAO and Raspberry Pi.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Includes a XIAO socket, a 40-pin header for Raspberry Pi, and a 4-pin Grove connector.
- **User Button**: A built-in user button for implementing various custom functions.

## Specification

- **Compatibility**: Designed for Seeed Studio XIAO and Raspberry Pi.
- **Communication Interface**: SPI (for connecting ePaper display).
- **User Button**: Two.
- **Grove Connector**: Two 4-pin, for I2C and UART communication .

## Getting Started with Arduino

Welcome to the quick start guide for the 2.9 inch ePaper Breakout Board. This guide aims to help you set up and get started with your new 2.9 inch ePaper Breakout Board in conjunction with the XIAO ESP32 C3 main controller.

1. **Insert XIAO ESP32 C3**: Insert the XIAO ESP32 C3 into the socket on the expansion board.
2. **Connect 2.9-inch ePaper Display**: Insert the 2.9-inch ePaper display into the FPC connector designated for the screen.
3. **Download Test Code**: Download the [test code](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/ePaper_029TestCode) onto the XIAO ESP32 C3 processor.
4. **Run and Observe**: After successfully downloading the code, you should see some logos displayed on the ePaper screen.
